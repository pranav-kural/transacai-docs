# Transac AI Docs

Transac AI Docs is the documentation website for [Transac AI](https://github.com/transac-ai) project.

TransacAI project is geared towards generation of enriched summaries and insights of transactional data in real-time or batch using Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). It goes beyond visual and analytical processing of transactional data by generating context-aware and enriched insights in natural language using LLMs. It focuses on delivering human-centric analysis that is easier to understand and act upon, eliminating the need for multiple complex data processing steps to derive insights from raw data.
