  Real-time AI-powered insights from transactional data using Generative AI and
  Large Language Models (LLMs).
</div>

Transac AI project is geared towards generation of **enriched summaries and insights** from complex transactional data in real-time or batch using **Generative AI** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

Imagine fine-tuned LLMs serving as a specialists working several times more efficiently than multiple human analysts, and capable of analyzing hundreds of transactions per second to generate insights and ensure compliance, risk management, and fraud detection; all in real-time. This is the power of **Transac AI**.

Transac AI is built using a highly scalable, available, and reliable [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)-based **distributed** **microservices** & **event-driven architecture**. This is enabled through the use of **low-latency** and **high-throughput** inter-connections between services using [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [Connect RPC](https://connectrpc.com/), and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

Core services are built using **Python**, **Node.js**, and **Go**, and are deployed and managed efficiently using [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform) on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) using services like the [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), [AWS EventBridge Scheduler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda), [Confluent Kafka](https://www.confluent.io/cloud-kafka), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), and more.
