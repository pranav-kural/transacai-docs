# Live Demo

To demonstrate real-world use of Transac AI, the **live demo** system currently is configured such that around 4 new transactions are injected every minute, and a new insights generation request is submitted to **Workload Manager Service (WMS)** every 15 minutes.

The ability to showcase these transactions being injected and the insights being generated in real-time is under development. In the meanwhile, below you can see some screenshots displaying the working of the demo behind the scenes.

## Simulating Transactions

The below screenshot from [AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) displays logs from one of the recent runs of the Lambda job that injects transactions into the `records` database.

The below image displays how the transactions injector lambda job publishes job status to AWS SQS queue. In case of an error, this queue can be used to trigger a notification to the concerned team or to stop demo insights generation pipeline.

## Submitting Insights Generation Requests to WMS

The below screenshot from [AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) displays logs from one of the recent runs of the Lambda job that uses `gRPC` to submit a new insights generation request to the core **Workload Manager Service (WMS)** of Transac AI project that runs on [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine).

## Generated Insights

The below screenshot is from the [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)-hosted PostgreSQL database that stores the generated insights for this demo. This screenshot displays an example of one of the generated insights.
